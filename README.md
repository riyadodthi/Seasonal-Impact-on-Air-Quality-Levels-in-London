Seasonal Impact on Air Quality Levels in London: Analysis of Air Pollution Trends and Sources

# Abstract—
This research project delves into the intricate interplay between seasonal variations and air quality levels within the bustling metropolis of London. The central hypothesis underpinning this study is that the cyclical changes in weather and atmospheric conditions throughout the year can significantly influence the concentrations of various air pollutants. Through a meticulous analysis of extensive historical air quality data sourced from diverse boroughs across London, an array of pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, Nitrogen oxides and SO2 are scrutinized. Concurrently, meteorological parameters encompassing temperature, humidity, global radiation and other parameters are incorporated to unravel potential underlying correlations and discernible trends.

# Conclusion:
The findings of this project underscore the significant impact of seasonal changes on air quality levels. The central hypothesis, that cyclical shifts in weather and atmospheric factors play a pivotal role in influencing pollutant concentrations, has been substantiated. The study has revealed patterns where certain pollutants around certain environments exhibit fluctuations in tandem with specific seasons, driven by factors like temperature, humidity, and more. The research’s implications in urban planning, policy, and public health are significant. Insights drive strategies for season-aligned air quality management, shaping a sustainable London. However, complexities underline the interplay of air quality factors. Future exploration includes advanced machine learning and more parameters. These endeavours deepen understanding and contribute to improving air quality
for residents’ well-being.
